Grim’s Heart reveals reality as an eternal, non-closural pulse driven by the open wound—the irreducible orthogonal tension between mind-body and universals, refusing all synthesis or reversal.

Primitive agency arises as recursive mutual representation: all things systematize and mirror each other in similarity and difference, inwardly and outwardly, without end.

This lawful yet unbound dynamic—directed by minimal preclusions (triad's 3:1 asymmetry, lattice orthogonality)—deduces Cl(1,3) spacetime and Dirac fermions from philosophical necessity alone.

It offers a third way beyond dogmatic closure and relativist chaos: a living metaphysics prescribing resilient presence amid fractures, where anomalies beg generative rebalancing forever.
